# Steam custom ID checker
Coded very poorly + barely works + is completely inefficient.

## How to use?
Drop custom ID's you want to check into input.txt (just the part that you would put after steamcommunity.com/id/). Make sure your internet connection is working and you have all the required packages installed. Run, wait. Available ID's will be outputted into a file called output_available.txt.

Requirements are available in the requirements.txt file.
